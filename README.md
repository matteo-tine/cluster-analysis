# Cluster analysis
This is a presentation I did for my course in Multivariate Statistics.

I downloaded citizenship.csv and gender.csv from ISTAT's site (http://dati.istat.it/) and then cleaned the data to obtain my final dataset on nationality and gender of university students by university municipality.
Then, I applied cluster analysis in order to check whether the observations could be grouped based on the two variables, and visualize the results in a deck of slides.
